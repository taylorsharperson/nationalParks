This is a database that I made using C++ and SQL. The purpose of this database is for people to find national parks near them and add any news ones as times goes on. There are menu options which include: 
find all Parks
find all Activities
find certain Activities
find all Visitors
find all Incidents
find by park ID
find activity by Parks
oldest Park
insert Park
delete Park
delete Visitors
insert Visitors
update Visitors
get Total Parks
